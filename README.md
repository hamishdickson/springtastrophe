We've all been there: your new REST project's going really well, you do everything right - someone suggests "Hey, we should use Spring" and then that cool swagger interface you want to use becomes almost impossible to use :(

This is a little project for scanning your springtastrophe and building that swagger content file thingy you'd otherwise have to write by hand

## Project Status

This project should be considered highly experimental and not production ready
